## The Goal
Create 8-bit electric guitar like Applecaster https://applecaster.jimdofree.com/

Guitar shoul be able to play itself without PC, MIDI, or anything but batteries.

## Hardware
Connect speaker to Pin3 and provide energy.

## Software
Unfortunatly I've found no soure code on Applecaster site so I'm reimplementing it.
Current verson is based on this project: https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Chiptunes/
I've removed precompiled music and it's unpacker. Right now it's able to play to play music by commands comming from Serial port.
